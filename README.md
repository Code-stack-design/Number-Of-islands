# Island Counter Visualizer

**A Python script to count and visually display islands in an `n × m` grid of Land ('L') and Water ('W') cells.**

## ​ Project Overview

This project reads a grid representation where each cell is either:
- **`L`** — Land  
- **`W`** — Water  

An island is defined as a group of **adjacent** land cells that can be connected **horizontally, vertically, or diagonally**. The script:
1. Counts the number of distinct islands using a DFS algorithm.  
2. Renders the grid in the terminal with visually distinct colors for land and water.
